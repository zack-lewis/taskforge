## Stuff I've Added

- Prisma: Used for DB access. Can be switched between different DB providers but I've settled on SQLITE for portability since this project is designed to be run as a singular instance for a single company, not for widespread use. [Prisma SQLITE](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/overview/databases/sqlite)
- ShadCN: Components to import instead of creating from scratch or using a library. Can be easily customized but not something I have to figure out how to build. [ShadCN Components](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/)
- NextAuth: Library used for authentication via providers
